# concrete compressive strength prediction
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Course with the United Network of Professionals (UNP). 
Key highlights of this project:
Studied and Analysed the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset to apply Machine Learning Models and also presented my insights of this project.
Performed Datacleaning and also Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
Experimented the dataset with different Machine Learning models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression, K - Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, XG Boost.
Compared the results of the above mentioned machine learning models to recommend the best Regression Model.
